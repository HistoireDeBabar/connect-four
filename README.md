# Connect Four...

This project was originally created for a simple play/test with dotnet core.

The rules follow the classic 'Connect Four' game and it supports a single player command line game.  You can literally waste seconds away while playing it.

## Starting the App

* Fork/Clone the repo 
* run dotnet build
* run dotnet run

## Issues

For a list of issues or improvements check the Issues of the repo in Github :octocat:

 _P.S I thought I'd be clever and update it to run on dotnet 2, however it's massively backfired and has stopped the tests running._
